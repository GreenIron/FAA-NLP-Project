    "(For § 29.79 after Amendment 29-38, see section 29.75A of this AC.)\n",
    "a. Explanation.\n",
    "(1) The height-speed envelope is normally referred to as the height-velocity (HV)\n",
    "diagram. It defines an envelope of airspeed and height above the ground from which a\n",
    "safe power-off or one engine inoperative (OEI) landing cannot be made. The diagram\n",
    "normally consists of three portions: (a) the level flight (cruise) portion, (b) the takeoff\n",
    "portion, and (c) the high speed portion (see Figure AC 29.79-1). The high speed portion\n",
    "is omitted on occasions when it can be shown that the rotorcraft can suffer an engine\n",
    "failure at low altitude and high speed (up to VH) and make a successful landing, or climb\n",
    "out on the remaining engine(s).\n",
    "(2) Engine power considerations are similar to those in previous takeoff and\n",
    "landing requirements (see sections 29.53, 29.63, and 29.75 of this AC).\n",
    "(3) The prohibited sections of the HV diagram are separated by the takeoff\n",

    "CATEGORY A.\n",
    "a. Explanation.\n",
    "(1) Amendment 29-39 added a new § 29.55 to redefine the TDP (previously\n",
    "called the CDP) and contained in § 29.53; it further removed the requirement to identify\n",
    "the TDP by height and airspeed, since height alone or other factors may be more\n",
    "appropriate. A Category A takeoff typically begins with an acceleration and/or climb\n",
    "from a hover to TDP. The rule requires that the TDP be defined for the pilot in terms of\n",
    "no more than two parameters such as an indicated height and airspeed combination.\n",
    "(2) The definition of the TDP is based on a minimum required total energy\n",
    "concept. A specific minimum combination of kinetic energy (airspeed) and potential\n",
    "energy (height) should be attained at the TDP to ensure that a continued takeoff can be\n",
    "accomplished following the complete failure of one engine. In § 29.55(b), TDP is\n",
    "required to be defined by no more than two parameters. When using a single\n",
    "parameter such as time, height, or airspeed as a method of identifying the TDP, the\n",
    "identification must be combined with a precisely defined takeoff path and crew\n",
    "procedure to provide the required equivalent level of safety. In addition, it should be\n",
    "demonstrated that the pilot technique used during the takeoff sequence is easily\n",
    "repeatable and consistently produces the required energy (i.e., airspeed and height\n",
    "combination) when the TDP time, height, or airspeed is attained. This condition should\n",

    "that if an engine failure occurs at or before the CDP, a safe landing can be made or if\n",
    "the engine fails at or after the CDP, the takeoff can be continued. The purpose of these\n",

    "Purpose: To inform aircraft operators of the need for pilots to coordinate with the appropriate\n",
    "air traffic facility when they plan a maneuver away from a cleared route.\n",
    "Background: Improved aircraft tracking and reporting equipment is coming into use both\n",
    "onboard trans-oceanic aircraft and in the air traffic facilities controlling trans-oceanic routes.\n",
    "These new technology applications mean that maneuvers from planned track in excess of\n",
    "standard Strategic Lateral Offset Procedures automatically are reported to air traffic facilities,\n",
    "sometimes before flight crews are able to contact the facility regarding their maneuvering. At\n",
    "present, this can be a problem from a control and airspace coordination standpoint. However, as\n",
    "capacity enhancements, such as reduced aircraft separation, come into use, maneuvers away\n",
    "from track without coordination become a greater concern.\n",
    "Discussion: The trans-oceanic flying environment usually involves long range flying that\n",
    "transits multiple weather systems. It is normal that flight crews would need to maneuver in\n",
    "oceanic airspace for the sake of flight safety, but they are required to coordinate such maneuvers\n",
    "with the appropriate air traffic facility. Oceanic traffic density is increasing, taking advantage of\n",
    "such technology as enhanced navigation, communication, and in particular surveillance. In this\n",
    "environment, coordination with air traffic facilities is increasingly important.\n",
    "Recommended action: Directors of safety, directors of operations (parts 121 and 135), training\n",

    "Background and Relevant Past Practice\n",
    "1.\n",
    "Past FAA certification projects involving WLAN systems focused on the downlink of\n",
    "information from satellites with limited uplink and transmission from the airplane cabin.\n",
    "The configuration of transmitters and receivers within the cabin was rigorously controlled\n",
    "and qualified to airplane installation standards.\n",
    "2.\n",
    "The current WLAN installation involves the use of several transmitters from various\n",
    "consumer electronic equipment (e.g., laptop/tablet computers, smart phones, etc.) whose\n",
    "transmission specifications and failure modes cannot be rigorously analyzed and tested due\n",
    "to the unregulated use of these devices on an airplane.\n",
    "3.\n",
    "New computer interfaces, networks and data protocols have been developed to use wireless\n",
    "radio-frequency (RF) links to transfer data. This allows communications without hard-\n",
    "wired connections. One approach uses IEEE standard 802.11a/b/g/n, which collectively is\n",
    "known as Wi-Fi, for wireless communication. IEEE 802.11b, g, and n use wideband\n",
    "digital modulation techniques in the 2400 to 2483.5 MHz band. IEEE 802.11a and n uses\n",
    "wideband digital modulation techniques in the 5250 to 5350 MHz and 5470 to 5825 MHz\n",
    "frequency bands. Wireless transmitters using IEEE 802.11a, b. g, or n protocol do not\n",

    "Events\n",
    "Purpose: This SAFO serves to raise awareness of aircraft misconfigurations on takeoff with an emphasis\n",
    "on flap position.\n",
    "Background: The Aviation Safety Information Analysis and Sharing (ASIAS) program recently\n",
    "concluded an analysis of flap misconfiguration events. This analysis included takeoff attempts with flaps\n",
    "set at zero and flap movement during the takeoff roll.\n",
    "Discussion: The ASIAS analysis indicates that while flap misconfiguration events on takeoff are rare,\n",
    "they do exist. Approximately half of the events for misconfiguration during the takeoff roll resulted in\n",
    "rejected takeoffs. The other takeoffs were continued with the flaps being moved during the takeoff roll.\n",
    "The configuration of the airplane by the flightcrew should be in accordance with the operational\n",
    "checklists. It is imperative that flightcrews exercise discipline in the use and the execution of operational\n",
    "checklists to prevent aircraft misconfigurations on takeoff.\n",
    "Recommended Action: Directors of Operations, Directors of Safety, Program Managers, Directors of\n",
    "Training, Training Center Program Managers, Check Pilots, Training Pilots, Chief Pilots and flightcrews\n",
    "should be familiar with the information contained in this SAFO. They should work together to ensure that\n",
    "the content of this SAFO is emphasized in their training programs to raise awareness among their\n",
    "flightcrews of flap misconfiguration events. This is especially important if procedures are being changed\n",
    "in light of the new Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) de-icing procedures. Operators should review\n",
    "their own Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) and Flight Operational Quality Assurance (FOQA)\n",
    "data for flap misconfiguration events. Operators are also reminded to conduct an analysis on any change\n",

    "applicable TSO marking.\n",
    "2.\n",
    "APPLICABILITY. This TSO affects new applications submitted after its effective date.\n",
    "a. All prior revisions to this TSO are no longer effective. Generally, we will not accept\n",
    "applications for the previous revision after the effective date of this TSO. We may do so,\n",
    "however, up to six months after it, if we know that you were working against the prior MPS\n",
    "before the new change became effective.\n",
    "b. Personnel parachute assemblies and components approved under a previous TSOA may\n",
    "still be manufactured under the provisions of its original approval.\n",
    "3. REQUIREMENTS. New models of personnel parachute assemblies and components\n",
    "identified and manufactured on or after the effective date of this TSO must meet the MPS\n",
